A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 4.x.

# License

# Serve
Run from [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):

```
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

Connect as `root` to the database launched using docker-compose (e.g. you can run exec on the container from nginx) and create a new `default` db for the project
(check `config/app_local.php` file for the credentials)

Connect to the nginx container using exec and run composer (do not run as root, but in order to set folder permissions root may be needed)

```
cd /var/www/cplatform/public/app_rest/
su composeruser
composer install
```

# Work with docker

Connect via ssh to dockerssh@localhost:2222 and the password: password

The local path is the location of this readme file and it should be mapped to `/var/www/cplatform/public`

When running test use `/var/www/cplatform/public/app_rest/phpunit.xml.dist` as default configuration file.
Also add `/var/www/cplatform/public/app_rest/vendor/autoload.php` as a default autoload file

# Running commands inside docker

* Connect to the container using [exec](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/)
* Navigate to the main path with `cd /var/www/cplatform/public/app_rest`
* Avoid running commands as root (since it can cause permission problems), change the user with: `su composeruser`

# Testing

You can run [tests](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/development/testing.html) using phpunit command: `vendor/bin/phpunit -c ../app_rest/phpunit.xml.dist`

But using an **IDE** is desirable (e.g. PhpStorm)

Generate test coverage with: `vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html ./webroot/coverage/*`

# Migrations

Migrations should be the only way to perform changes in the database schema

More info about [phinx](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/migrations.html) and the migration plugin on [cake book](https://book.cakephp.org/migrations/3/en/index.html)

```
# create a new migration called 'CreateUsers'
bin/cake bake migration CreateUsers

# execute the migration on the db
bin/cake migrations migrate

# revert the migration on the db
bin/cake migrations rollback

# create new seeds
bin/cake bake seed Users

# run seeder
bin/cake migrations seed

# run specific seeder class
bin/cake migrations seed --seed UsersSeed
```
